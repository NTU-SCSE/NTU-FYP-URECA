hi my name is frank and i collect secrets it all started with a crazy idea in november of 2004 i printed up 3000 self addressed postcards just like this they were blank on one side and on the other side i listed some simple instructions i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they would never told anyone before and i handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of washington dc not knowing what to expect but soon the idea began spreading virally people began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards i started receiving secrets in my home mailbox not just with postmarks from washington dc but from texas california vancouver new zealand iraq soon my crazy idea did not seem so crazy
