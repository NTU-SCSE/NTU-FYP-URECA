everybody talks about happiness these days i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 and there were many more there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness coaching everybody would like to make people happier but in spite of all this flood of work there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps this applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we are just as messed up as anybody else is the first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we apply it to too many different things i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that we will have to give up and we will have to adopt the more complicated view of what wellbeing is
